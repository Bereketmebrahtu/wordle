# wordle

Attempted at tackling the user Interface revamp of the worlde app design. 
Used basic HTML, CSS styling for asthetics and JavaScript for functionality.
Utilised JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques to traverse the nodes targeting elements and created elements using the createElement method.
Then gave our elements Id and class names using the setAttribute method followed by append elements.

Not fully implemented but the idea was to apply a shuffle option to give a user a chance to view letters from a different perspective for improved success at solving the challenge.
I would use Math.random method to generate random numbers and create a data of Arrays to general random letters, which then will be changing tile position giving it a shuffle effect.
